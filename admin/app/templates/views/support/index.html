    <h3 class="heading-small">Out-of-hours</h3>
    <p>Outside office hours, response times depend on whether you’re reporting an emergency or not.</p>
    <p>If it’s an emergency, we’ll reply within 30 minutes and update you every hour until the problem’s fixed.</p>
    <p>A problem is only classed as an emergency if:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>nobody on your team can sign in</li>
      <li>a ‘technical difficulties’ error appears when you try to upload a file</li>
      <li>a 500 response code appears when you try to send messages using the API</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ll reply during the next working day for any other problems.</p>
