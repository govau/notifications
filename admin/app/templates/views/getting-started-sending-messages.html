      <h1 class="heading-large">Sending messages</h1>

      <p>
        When you send a message, it moves through different states in Notify.
      </p>

      <img style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;" src="{{ asset_path }}images/sending-messages.png" alt="Message states">

      <h3 class="heading-small">Sending</h3>
      <p>
        This means that we have accepted the message and are sending it to our delivery providers.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Delivered</h3>
      <p>
        You’ll see this when Notify has successfully delivered a message to user’s email inbox or phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notify will not tell you if a user has opened or read a message.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Sent internationally</h3>
      <p>
        You will see this when Notify sends a text message to an international number, but mobile networks in that country don’t provide delivery receipts.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Phone number or email address does not exist</h3>
      <p>
        You will see this when Notify could not deliver a message because the email address or phone number was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should remove these email addresses or phone numbers from your database.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will still be charged for text messages to numbers that do not exist.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Inbox/phone not accepting messages right now</h3>
      <p>
        You will see this if Notify cannot deliver an email or text message after trying for 72 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        This might happen for a number of reasons. For example, the user’s inbox might be full, or their phone might be turned off.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can try sending the message again if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will still be charged for text messages to phones that are not accepting messages.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Technical failure</h3>
      <p>
        A technical failure means there’s a problem between Notify and our delivery providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will have to try sending your messages again.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will not be charged for text messages that are affected by a technical failure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Receiving messages</h2>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Email replies</h3>

      <p>
        You can choose an email address you want replies to go to.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Text messages</h3>
      <p>
        You can contact us if you want to be able to receive text messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you have done this, users will be able to reply to text messages you send them. They will also be able to start an interaction by sending you a text message.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will be able to see and reply to text messages you receive. You can also create automated processes to manage replies.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will still need to have a manual process in place for any messages that can’t be dealt with automatically.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium">Multiple services in one organisation</h2>

      <p>
        If your organisation offers multiple services, you can have a different Notify account for each of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each service:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>gets its own free message allowance</li>
        <li>has to request to go live separately</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
