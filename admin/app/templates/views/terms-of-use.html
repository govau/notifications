      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      Notify is the online notifications service offered by the Digital
      Transformation Agency (DTA), that provides government entities the
      capability to send emails and text messages to their users. Notify is
      currently in a Beta testing stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A notification typically takes the form of status updates, requests for
      action, acknowledgement of receipt of applications or supporting
      information, and reminders. Notify makes it easier to keep people updated,
      by helping service teams across government send text messages and emails
      to their users.
    </p>
    <p>
      Government entities will continue to collect, manage and control their
      users contact information and preferences. Notify simply processes the
      notification to users of the service at the request of the service team.
      Notify is not a contact database for Australian citizens.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Protect sensitive information</strong></p>
    <p>
      Notify makes a copy of messages you send available through the dashboard
      for 7 days after sending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some messages that you send include sensitive information like security
      codes or password reset links. Messages you send will likely also include
      personal information.

    <p>
      If you’re sending a message with sensitive information or personal
      information, you can choose to hide those details from view through the

      to see that information, while service team users of Notify will not.
