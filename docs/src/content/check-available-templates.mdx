# Listing available templates

Notify allows you to inspect which templates are available. This could allow you
to build your own interfaces or integrate with tools that use Notify.

For example, you could build a service which checks for which templates are
availble, inspects which variables they require, and then presents an operator
with a form to fill out which could submit and send messages using that
template.
