# Getting started

Notify offers client libraries in a range of languages to make integration easy.
Get started right away by installing a client that matches your development
environment.

## Installing your Notify library

<Examples reference="setup-install" title="Installing your Notify library" />

## Set up Notify client

The Notify client needs to be set up so that it can access your
organisation's service. Log in to Notify and create or find the service you want
to use, go to **Services › API integration › API keys** to create or manage API
keys.

Create an API key by navigating to **API keys › Create an API key**.
You and your team will lose the ability to view this key in the dashboard after
you create it as a security precaution. You'll need to generate a new key if you
ever lose track of them.

## Unsupported languages

We're not ready to expose our REST API directly. If you use a programming
language that we don't support, please
[get in touch](mailto:notify-support@digital.gov.au) with us and we can work something
out.
