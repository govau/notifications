# Accepting callbacks

A callback lets you receive messages from Notify to a URL you choose.

You should make sure that the callbacks to your URL are coming from Notify by 
providing a "bearer token" when you set up the callback URL.
You should keep this bearer token secure and rotate it if you have any reason
to think that it might no longer be trusted.

When you accept a callback from Notify, you should check that the bearer token
we send is the same as what you've set up. This could be a hashed value so
that Notify doesn't hold the true token.

The callback message will be delivered in JSON.

## Message delivery receipts

When you send an email or text message through Notify, we can send a receipt to your callback URL to tell you if we were able to deliver it or not.
