# Send a message

You can use Notify to send text messages, emails and letters.

This API allows you to send text or email notifications to users and track
their progress. You might send out notifications in response to some
user-generated event, like sending someone a receipt after they apply to your
service. You might also send out notifications as a reminder, like if a payment
is due.

## Getting ready

To send an email message in Notify, you'll need to set up a template in the user
interface. Go to **Services › Templates › Add a template** to get started.

Once you've got a template ready, find the template ID associated with
it. You'll need that ID to specify which template you want to use when you call
our API.


## Personalisation

Personalisation allows you to customise what information shows up in a specific email
as it gets sent out. You might use this to address a user by their name, provide
them with a specific link to click, or give them a receipt number so they have a
reference to a transaction.

Any personalisations that you set up in your template will be necessary to
include when you go to send a message through the API.

## Sending an email

Notify allows you to send email messages one-by-one. Each message should be
configured in your service.

## Sending a SMS

Sending an SMS is similar to sending an email. Send them one-by-one to a
recipient. If you set up a reply number in the Notify interface, you'll be able
to capture replies from your users.
