# Send a message

You can use Notify to send text messages and emails.

This API allows you to send text or email notifications to users and track
their progress. You might send out notifications in response to some
user-generated event, like sending someone a receipt after they apply to your
service. You might also send out notifications as a reminder, like if a payment
is due.

## Getting ready

To send an email message in Notify, you'll need to set up a template in the user
interface. Go to **Services › Templates › Add a template** to get started.

Once you've got a template ready, find the template ID associated with
it. You'll need that ID to specify which template you want to use when you call
our API.

## Personalisation

Personalisation allows you to change what shows up in a specific message as it
gets sent out. You might use personalisation to:

- Address a user by their name
- Provide users with a specific link to click
- Send a unique transaction number as a follow up

Your API call must include any fields that have been set up as personalisations.

## Sending an email

Notify allows you to send email messages one-by-one. You should configure these
messages in user interface for each service.

## Sending an SMS

Sending an SMS is similar to sending an email. Send them one-by-one to a
recipient. If you set up a reply number in the Notify interface, you'll be able
to capture replies from your users.
