# Get message status

You can use the Notify API to retrieve the status of one or more messages.

In the code, we call these status objects `Notifications`, which provide message metadata as well as delivery status. You can only retrieve information for messages up to seven days old.

## Get the status of one message

You can use the Notify API to get a single message status.

## Get the status of multiple messages

You can also use the Notify API to find the status of multiple messages at the same time.
