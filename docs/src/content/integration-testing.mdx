# Integration testing

There are different types of API keys that let you do functional or performance integration testing. You don’t need different Notify accounts or access to other Notify environments.

<Contents />

## Types of API keys

|                    |                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Live               | sends to anyone            |
| Team and whitelist | limits who you can send to |
| Test               | pretends to send messages  |

## Live key

Once your service is live you are able to create Live keys. You can then use these keys to send messages to anyone.

Messages sent with a live key show up on your dashboard and count against your text message and email allowances.

You should revoke and re-create these keys on a regular basis. You can have more than one active key at a time. To revoke a key click the revoke button on the API Key page.

> You should never send test messages to invalid numbers or addresses using a live key. This will lead to your API key being revoked.

## Team and whitelist key

Use a team and whitelist key for end-to-end functional testing.

A team and whitelist key lets you send real messages to members of your team and addresses/numbers that you have added to your whitelist. You will get an error if you use these keys to send messages to anyone else.

Messages sent with a team and whitelist key show up on your dashboard and count against your text message and email allowances.

## Test key

Use a test key to test the performance of your service and its integration with Notify.

Test keys don’t send real messages but do generate realistic responses. There’s no restriction on who you can send to.

Messages sent using a test key don’t show up on your dashboard or count against your text message and email allowances.

By default, all messages sent with a test key will result in a delivered status.

If you want to test failure responses with a test key, use the following numbers and addresses:

|                                   |                   |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 0409000003                        | temporary failure |
| 0409000002                        | permanent failure |
| temp-fail@simulator.notify        | temporary failure |
| perm-fail@simulator.notify        | permanent failure |
| any other valid number or address | delivered         |

## Smoke testing your integration

If you need to smoke test your integration with Notify on a regular basis, you should use the smoke test numbers and addresses below.

|                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| 07700900111                                |
| 07700900222                                |
| 07700900333                                |
| simulate-delivered@notify.digital.gov.au   |
| simulate-delivered-2@notify.digital.gov.au |
| simulate-delivered-3@notify.digital.gov.au |

The smoke test numbers and addresses will immediately return a successful response, but won’t send a real message and won’t produce a delivery receipt. The notification ID is not a real ID, you will not be able to fetch the notification by ID.

You can use the smoke test numbers and addresses with any type of key. If your smoke tests need to get the status of a message, then use a test key and don’t use these numbers and addresses.
